# CPPDS-linkedlist
A linked list in C++ is a data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference to the next element. It allows dynamic size and efficient insertions and deletions.

Algorithm:
1. Create a node structure with data and next pointer fields.
2. Create a linked_list class with a private head pointer.
3. Define add_node_beg to add a new node at the beginning of the list.
4. Define del_node_end to delete a node from the end of the list.
5. Define add_node_end to add a new node at the end of the list.
6. Define display_all to display all nodes in the list.
7. In the main function, create a linked_list instance.
8. Display a menu with options to add at the beginning, delete from the end, and display all.
9. Use a loop to execute the chosen option, providing an exit option.
